## Breadcrumb

Notes: The Breadcrumb block is built automatically into all pages with the Page metadata template set to `guides`. On the guides pages the category in the page metadata should be set to one of the 4 main categories (Build, Publish, Author, Resources). However, this block can also be added to pages outside of the guide template on an as needed basis.

Side Navigation is styled in the block CSS code.

There is no Javascript code needed for decoration.

The CSS Styling is very project specific and gets adjusted as needed for a project or block by block.
